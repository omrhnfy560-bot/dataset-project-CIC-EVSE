EV Charger Attack Dataset 2024 (CICEVSE2024)

This repository is created for the course project using the CIC EV Charger Attack Dataset 2024 (CICEVSE2024).  
The dataset focuses on cybersecurity threats targeting Electric Vehicle (EV) charging systems and includes multiple attack scenarios for research and machine learning tasks.

Project Overview
The goal of this project is to analyze the dataset, prepare it for machine learning, and develop models to detect and classify different attack types.  

The project will include:
Data exploration and preprocessing  
Feature engineering  
Machine learning model development  
Evaluation and comparison of results
